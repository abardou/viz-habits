## Visualizations
### App Graph
![](previews/AppGraph.png)

The AppGraph visualization aims to represent habits in app navigation with a directed weighted graph. Nodes are apps and a link from node A to node B represents the switch between the app A and the app B. The links are weighted according to how often the switch occurs in the data. For more precise information, we can consider printing the frequency in its absolute form or in its relative form (percentage or probability). This graph can also be considered as a Markov Chain with some hypothesis.
